# Salt Kata Series

## Kata 3 - Roman Numerals

### A. Scenario

Being a software developer involves a lot of logical problem solving and being able to do that in a readable and well structured manner. You should also be able to test your logic to make sure it runs as expected even if you were to refactor your code or make additions to it.

### B. What you will be working on

Today you will be solving the classic FizzBuzz kata. By the end of the lab we want you to:

- Have gained even more C# and `dotnet` understanding.
- Get even better at unit testing and get comfortable with using `xUnit` and `NUnit`
- You will also learn about different ways to
- Get better at solving problems as a team.

### C. Setup

- Add a solution `RomanNumerals.Kata`
- Create test project `RomanNumerals.Tests` with a test framework and assertion library of you choice
- Create a class library `RomanNumerals` to hold your production code
- Add a reference from the tests to the production code.

### D. Lab instructions

#### Roman Numerals

Another classic kata.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)

> The numeric system represented by Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. Numbers in this system are represented by combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet. Roman numerals, as used today, are based on seven symbols:

| Symbol | I   | V   | X   | L   | C   | D   | M     |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| Value  | 1   | 5   | 10  | 50  | 100 | 500 | 1,000 |

_Note that Roman numerals are not defined for zero or negative numbers!_

#### The Kata

Create a _roman numeral convert_ that converts Arabic numbers to roman numerals.
Develop the code TDD style.
Make sure it works for all Arabic numbers between 1 and 3000. You don't have to test all numbers, but you have to test enough to be confident you have a working solution.

If you have time, you can also convert in the opposite direction, i.e. convert from Roman numerals to Arabic Numbers.

#### TDD

Develop the code TDD style, i.e. follow the work flow **Red**, **Green**, **Refactor**.

Good luck and have fun!
